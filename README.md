# Note from Peisen

This project is a multi-process image concatenator that can put the image fragments it fetched from the given website together and generate the complete PNG files. The regarding test websites are located inside UWaterloo's internal network so testing/demonstrating it here could be difficult. However, you may still view the code I wrote here. The main file of interest is paster2.c which contains self-explaining comments.
